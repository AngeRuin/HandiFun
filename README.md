![HandiFun Project Banner](handifun.png)
### **Project Goal**
HandiFun is an innovative application designed to enhance interactive and kinesthetic learning experiences. It allows users to manipulate **complex 3D geometric shapes** in a virtual environment using only **hand gestures**.

### **Key Features**
* **Intuitive Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes camera input and computer vision to translate real-time hand movements into 3D object controls.
* **3D Environment:** Renders and displays various 3D shapes (like Platonic solids) for manipulation.
* **Interactive Learning:** Provides a tangible and engaging way to explore geometry, spatial reasoning, and 3D concepts.

### **Technology Stack**
* **Core Technology:** MediaPipe, Three.js,
* **Languages:** Python, CSS, JavaScript
